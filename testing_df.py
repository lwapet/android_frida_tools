=======================
Boxplot drawer function
=======================

This example demonstrates how to pass pre-computed box plot
statistics to the box plot drawer. The first figure demonstrates
how to remove and add individual components (note that the
mean is the only value not shown by default). The second
figure demonstrates how the styles of the artists can
be customized.

A good general reference on boxplots and their history can be found
here: http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/boxplots.pdf
